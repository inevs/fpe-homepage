Responsive Favicons
-------------------

This module adds the favicons generated by http://realfavicongenerator.net/ to
your site. The responsive name comes from the fact that many devices are
catered for including iPhone, Android, iPad, other tablets and dektops.

This module can prove to be really useful in Drupal multisite setups where you
do not want to pollute the base of the docroot with loads of icons that pertain
to only a single site. This module allows you to store per site variations of
the icons, in each site's respective public files directory.


Requirements
------------

* Drupal 8
* Favicon files generated by http://realfavicongenerator.net/
* HTML code generated by http://realfavicongenerator.net/


Installation and configuration
------------------------------

1. Generate the favicons and the HTML code on http://realfavicongenerator.net/

   You will need a 260x260px PNG file with appropriate transparency already
   created. Smaller files can be uploaded but these will produce inferior
   results.

   When asked for the "path" in realfavicongenerator.net select "I will place
   favicon files (favicon.ico, apple-touch-icon.png, etc.) at the root of my web
   site. Recommended." - this is because Drupal will rewrite the URLs based on
   your configuration of the module for you.

2. Install Responsive Favicons module as you install a contributed Drupal module.
   See https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules/themes/modules-7

3. Go to /admin/config/user-interface/responsive_favicons to configure the
   module.

   Here you will need to paste in the HTML provided by realfavicongenerator.net
   and upload the zip file they provided you with.

4. [optional] You can also allow this module to take over common paths like:

   * favicon.ico
   * apple-touch-icon.png
   * apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png
   * browserconfig.xml

   In order to do this you need to:

   1) Comment out the line

   #RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !=/favicon.ico

   in the Drupal root .htaccess file.

   2) Alter the config setting system.performance.fast_404.exclude_paths in your settings.php file:

   $config['system.performance']['fast_404']['exclude_paths'] = '/\/(?:styles)\/|(?:system\/files)\/|favicon\.ico|apple-touch-icon(?:-precomposed)?\.png|browserconfig\.xml/';

You site will now output the required metadata for the favicons to work. You can
always check the status report page to find out if your site has been correctly
configured.

Note. The 'favicon' module duplicates some of the functionality of responsive
favicons, so it is preferred that you only install one of the two modules.
