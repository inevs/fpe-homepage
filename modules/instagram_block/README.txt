INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a very simple module that integrates with Instagram and creates a
block containing your most recent Instagram posts.

The block's configuration page lets you choose how many posts and what size
they should appear in the block. The images are individually exposed to the
drupal theme layer, so developers have access to an all of the variables
provided by the Instagram API should they choose to extent the block.

For more informations see the Instagram developer pages:
http://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/users/#get_users_media_recent

REQUIREMENTS
------------

No special requirements.

INSTALLATION
------------

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See:
https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/extending-drupal/installing-contributed-modules
for further information.

CONFIGURATION
------------
To add Instagram Block to specific content region Go to Block Layout.
i.e Home-> Administration-> Structure-> Block layout.

You also need to add the Instagram Access Token of the Instagram account
you are pulling posts from as part of the block configuration.

MULTIPLE BLOCKS
------------
You can have multiple blocks pulling posts from different Instagram accounts.
To configure additional access tokens, you need to add it on the Instagram
app. You can do this by going to this url:

https://www.instagram.com/developer/clients/manage/

After that, click on manage in your app and go to Sandbox and add the users
there. After that you need to login in to the new Instragram account and
accept this request. With that you can use the new users id.

Another options is to publish your app on Instagram and ask for public_content
permission, with that you will have access to all public profiles.
